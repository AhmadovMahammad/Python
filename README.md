# My Python Journey for Interview Preparation

## Introduction
As a C# developer, I realized the importance of diversifying my programming language skills to better prepare for coding interviews. 
I came across advice in the book, which highlighted that knowing only one or two languages could be a limitation during interviews. 
This motivated me to step out of my c# zone and learn Python.

Pythonâ€™s simplicity and versatility made it an ideal choice for tackling Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) on platforms like LeetCode. 
By learning Python, I was able to expand my problem-solving toolkit, 
improve my interview performance, and become more adaptable in different coding environments.
